# ajax-data-table
A light weight JavaScript library to generate HTML data tables on-the-fly, fast, easy to use, bootstrap supported and easy to customize.

Initially, ajax-data-table was created to use in SiteEngine, an e-commerce platform, which created xuanhanh.vn, 
a cosmetics store in Viet Nam. During the development, ajax-data-table is now very flexible and can help developpers 
to create HTML tables quickly and easily.
